        <h3 class="caps">How do these sites work?</h3>
        <p>Hazard Ready sites are designed to help educate and prepare people for disasters that occur in their area. Disasters don't strike locations equally so we found it important to give location
        specific information in order to properly prepare. Each site organizes current information and packages it in a way that makes it accessible for any area resident.</p>
        <p>Hazard Ready sites use the most up-to-date hazard risk data available for their locale. The user of this site is responsible for verifying any particular information with the original data sources. Although these data represent the best current assessment of hazards, they are not predictive of future events. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are based on best information from the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

        <h3 class="caps">Who made them?</h3>
        <p>Hazard Ready sites are based on <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/widget/aftershock-find-your-cascadia-earthquake-story/" target="_blank">Aftershock</a>, an earthquake preparedness application for Oregon residents. Carson MacPherson-Krutsky and <a href="https://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/faculty/bendick/" target="_blank">Dr. Rebecca Bendick</a>, a graduate student and her advisor at the Unversity of Montana, had the idea to expand it for other locales and types of disasters. <a href="https://github.com/nein09" target="_blank">Melinda Minch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eldang" target="_blank">Eldan Goldenberg</a> adapted it for that purpose. Source for a general-purpose version of these sites is available on <a href="https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
